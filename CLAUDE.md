## Project Architecture

This is the **Hammurabi Server** - a headless implementation of the Decentraland protocol that runs entirely in Node.js without browser dependencies.

### Core Architecture Components

**Engine Entry (`src/lib/engine-main.ts`)**
- Creates Babylon.js NullEngine (no WebGL/canvas)
- Generates guest identity for authentication
- Fetches realm configuration from `/about` endpoint
- Routes to local or remote scene loading based on realm URL
- Manages all subsystems initialization

**Scene Loading System (`src/lib/babylon/scene/load.ts`)**
- `loadSceneContextFromLocal`: Local development with hot reload via file watching
- `loadSceneContextFromPosition`: Fetches scenes from Genesis City by coordinates
- Uses content server API: `/content/entities/active` for remote scenes
- Handles scene manifests and asset URLs

**Scene Runtime (`src/lib/babylon/scene/`)**
- `SceneContext`: Central state manager for CRDT messages and entity lifecycle
- `BabylonEntity`: Component-based wrapper around Babylon.js objects
- Scene code runs inside a **QuickJS (WASM) sandbox** (`src/lib/quick-js/`),
  communicating with the host only over `@dcl/rpc` on a `MemoryTransport`. This
  is the security boundary: scene code is untrusted (authored by scene
  deployers) and the QuickJS interpreter gives it no access to Node globals
  (`process`, `require`, host `Function`/`eval`), so it cannot read the worker's
  private key or execute host code. The VM is bounded by memory / stack ceilings
  and a per-turn execution deadline (`withQuickJsVm`).
- DO NOT run scene code via `new Function`/`eval` in the host realm. A previous
  `with (proxy)` + allowlist "sandbox" was removed because it was trivially
  escapable (`Function('return this')()` reaches the real global); all scene
  execution must go through the QuickJS runtime.
- Scene-facing capability APIs (`~system/SignedFetch`, `~system/UserIdentity`)
  use a separate **unprivileged guest identity** (`sceneIdentity`), never the
  server's authoritative identity, and `SignedFetch` enforces an SSRF egress
  guard (`src/lib/misc/ssrf.ts`).
- **Untrusted-input bounds (do not remove).** Scene CRDT/assets and remote-peer
  comms are parsed in HOST code, outside the VM's limits, so these caps are
  load-bearing:
  the CRDT reader (`crdt-wire-protocol/message.ts` `readAllMessages`) must never
  spin on an unknown/zero-length message (host hang), and `crdtMessageProtocol.ts`
  rejects a declared length shorter than the 8-byte header; `scene-context.ts`
  caps live entities, delete-tombstones, and CRDT payload size / queue depth;
  `connect-context-rpc.ts` `sendBinary` caps peers/messages/size to bound
  scene→LiveKit amplification, and its `signedFetch` follows redirects MANUALLY,
  re-running the SSRF guard on every hop (fetch would otherwise auto-follow a
  redirect onto a private host); both `scene.update()` and `scene.lateUpdate()`
  are wrapped in try/catch (`update-scheduler.ts`) so a malformed CRDT can't crash
  the shared render loop; the XHR polyfill caps response size and treats non-2xx
  as an error (never feeds an error body to the native glTF parser);
  `coerceMaybeU8Array` guards null / caps size.
  Inbound comms: `CommsTransportWrapper.handleMessage` drops oversized packets and
  rate-limits per peer before decoding; the avatar system dedupes + rate-limits
  per-peer profile fetches (`avatar-communication-system.ts`) to bound Catalyst
  amplification, drops non-finite peer transforms, and caps its tombstone map.
- **QuickJS execution deadline (`quick-js/index.ts`).** The per-turn deadline is
  reset at the START of every synchronous entry into the VM (eval / onStart /
  onUpdate / each setImmediate callback / each `executePendingJobs`), NOT
  cumulatively — a time-based "reset on gap" heuristic false-kills long-lived
  scenes once the sum of their turns crosses the budget. A separate async-turn
  timeout bounds a never-settling onUpdate promise. `require()` results are
  cached so repeated calls don't leak host handles; VM teardown always disposes
  even if job-draining times out.
- **Binary marshalling (`quick-js/convert-handles.ts`).** Uint8Arrays cross the
  VM boundary through the WASM ArrayBuffer APIs (`newArrayBuffer` /
  `getArrayBuffer`), NOT as JSON text — the JSON detour measured 2-3 orders of
  magnitude slower and silently corrupted nested payloads (empty `sendBinary`).
  The VM-side classifier/wrapper helpers are compiled BEFORE any scene code runs
  and their handles are host-private (never exposed on the VM global), so a
  scene cannot see or replace what the host calls to read its values; every
  primordial they touch (brand check via `Object.prototype.toString`, the
  `%TypedArray%.prototype.buffer` getter) is captured at install time so
  prototype poisoning can't forge host-side bytes. Per-payload (16MB) and
  per-value (4096 buffers) caps bound host allocations; these are load-bearing.
- **Scene bundle evaluation (`quick-js/rpc-scene-runtime.ts`).** The scene main
  file is evaluated inside a CommonJS-style function wrapper, NOT as a raw global
  script. Reference runtimes do the same and scenes depend on it: a top-level
  `var` in the bundle must not become a `globalThis` property (e.g. the SDK's
  `var DEBUG_NETWORK_MESSAGES = () => globalThis.DEBUG_NETWORK_MESSAGES ?? false`
  vs. the documented `globalThis.DEBUG_NETWORK_MESSAGES = true` debug flag —
  global-scope eval lets the flag overwrite the function and the scene crashes
  with "not a function" when a player joins). The wrapper is single-line so
  bundle stack-trace line numbers are preserved.
- Scene assets can only be fetched from the scene's own content manifest
  (`baseUrl + content-hash`); arbitrary-URL/host asset fetches are not possible,
  and only the glTF/GLB loader is registered.
- Entity ID allocation: 1 for local player, 32-255 for remote players

**Communications System**
- **LiveKit Transport** (`src/lib/decentraland/communications/transports/livekit.ts`)
  - Uses `@livekit/rtc-node` for Node.js WebRTC
  - Room connection without browser APIs
  - Handles `connectionState` instead of browser `state` property
- **Adapter System** (`src/lib/decentraland/communications/connect-adapter.ts`)
  - `connectLocalAdapter`: Local preview via comms-gatekeeper
  - `connectGenesisAdapter`: Production Genesis City connections
  - `connectProductionAdapter`: Flexible production realm connections
  - Protocol support: livekit, ws-room, offline, signed-login
- **Comms Gatekeeper URLs**:
  - Local: `https://comms-gatekeeper-local.decentraland.org`
  - Production: `https://comms-gatekeeper.decentraland.zone`

**RPC Services (`src/lib/babylon/scene/connect-context-rpc.ts`)**
- Scene-kernel communication via RPC protocol
- Service definitions: Runtime, Permissions, UserIdentity, PortableExperiences, CommsApi
- CRDT message passing between scene and kernel

**CLI Interface (`src/cli.ts`)**
- Command-line argument parsing: `--realm`, `--position`, `--authenticated`
- XMLHttpRequest polyfill for Babylon.js GLTF loading
- Global error handlers that keep server running
- Restart listener for 'r' key during development

### Technical Details

**Node.js Requirements**
- Version 18+ (uses native fetch API)
- No DOM polyfills needed
- Custom XMLHttpRequest implementation for asset loading

**Babylon.js Adaptations**
- Always uses NullEngine (no rendering)
- Avatar system without UI textures when OffscreenCanvas unavailable
- Simplified materials and lighting for headless mode
- All packages pinned to version 6.4.1 for compatibility

**Build System**
- TypeScript compilation to `dist/` folder
- esbuild creates `dist/worker-bundle.cjs` for CommonJS compatibility
- Worker bundle excludes native modules and Node.js built-ins
- Production builds include minification and tree-shaking

## Key Implementation Notes

**Position Parameter**
- Format: `--position=x,y` for Genesis City coordinates
- Required for remote realms, not for localhost
- Fetches scene from content server's active entities

**Realm Detection**
- localhost/127.0.0.1: Uses local scene loading with hot reload
- Other URLs: Requires position parameter for remote scene fetching
- Default realm: `https://peer.decentraland.org` for Genesis City

**Error Resilience**
- Global uncaught exception handlers prevent crashes
- Scene errors logged but don't stop server
- Communications failures handled gracefully

**Development Mode**
- Hot reload via file watching for local scenes
- Nodemon integration for source code changes
- Press 'r' to manually restart during development
